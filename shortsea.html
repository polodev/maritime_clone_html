					The IMDO are committed to providing the most up-to-date and comprehensive database of maritime transport. The office publishes an annual statistical bulletin, the Irish Maritime Transport Economist. This is a comprehensive reference for maritime transport statistics, including trade, traffic, international shipping markets and economic data. On a regular basis the IMDO also provide updated quarterly freight reviews. These quarterly reviews detail traffic and trade with other European countries. In this section of the IMDO website you will find the Irish Maritime Transport Economist and our iShip Index. The iShip index is a volume index for all freight traffic moved to and from the Republic of Ireland. This does not include passengers and transhipment activity. The Irish Maritime Development Office also produces a regular e-zine with Irish maritime and shipping related news.
